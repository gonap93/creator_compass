# Codebase Refactoring and Optimization

## Overview
This PR implements a comprehensive refactoring of the codebase to improve code organization, maintainability, and performance without changing any existing functionality.

## Changes
- [ ] Authentication Flow Optimization
  - Consolidate authentication logic into a cohesive pattern
  - Create a single authentication service class
  - Improve error handling and type safety

- [ ] API Route Organization
  - Reorganize API routes by feature
  - Group related endpoints together
  - Implement consistent error handling

- [ ] State Management Consolidation
  - Implement robust state management for shared data
  - Reduce component-level state where appropriate
  - Improve data flow patterns

- [ ] Firebase Utilities Optimization
  - Create structured Firebase service layer
  - Improve separation of concerns
  - Enhance type safety and error handling

- [ ] Type System Improvements
  - Create centralized types directory
  - Enforce stricter TypeScript configurations
  - Improve type definitions and interfaces

- [ ] Component Composition
  - Break down larger components
  - Improve component reusability
  - Enhance component testing capabilities

- [ ] Error Handling Standardization
  - Implement consistent error handling patterns
  - Create custom error types
  - Add centralized error handling service

- [ ] API Response Types
  - Create strict type definitions for API responses
  - Implement proper error handling for API calls
  - Add response validation

- [ ] Environment Configuration
  - Move configuration values to environment variables
  - Create centralized configuration service
  - Improve security of sensitive data

- [ ] Code Splitting and Lazy Loading
  - Implement proper code splitting
  - Add dynamic imports for routes
  - Optimize bundle size

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for new services and utilities
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] Component tests for refactored components
- [ ] End-to-end tests for critical user flows

## Documentation
- [ ] Update README with new architecture
- [ ] Document new services and utilities
- [ ] Add inline documentation for complex logic
- [ ] Update API documentation

## Migration Notes
No database migrations required. This is a code-only refactoring.

## Performance Impact
Expected improvements:
- Reduced bundle size through code splitting
- Faster initial load times
- Better caching through improved state management
- Reduced API response times through optimized data fetching

## Security Considerations
- Improved type safety reduces potential runtime errors
- Better error handling prevents information leakage
- Centralized configuration improves security management
- Enhanced authentication flow security

## Dependencies
No new dependencies added. Existing dependencies will be optimized for usage.
